I am a secondary school science and mathematics teacher at Juniata Mennonite School in central Pennsylvania. I currently teach 8-12 grade science, Precalculus, Statistics, and chess, but I have also recently taught Calculus and other math subjects. My main love is for Jesus and for my wife but I also love the overlap of mathematics and computing.
